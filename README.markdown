Penumbra Overture Source Code
=======================

Yes, here it is at last the first game in the Penumbra Series.

Read through the TODO file for various known things that should be cleaned up / fixed.

Included are project files for Xcode, Visual Studio 2003 and Cmake (for Linux)


Using OpenIL
------------

This version of Penumbra:Overture is being modified to use the OpenIL library developed by [Dimeox](http://www.dimeox.com). 

We use Visual Studio 2010 to develop this mod of the game using the library. You will need to include the OpenIL library in your Visual Studio project. To do it, just follow these [instructions](https://github.com/jorgeas80/PenumbraOverture/releases/tag/openil)

Contributing Code
-----------------
We encourage everyone to contribute code to this project, so just sign up for a github account, create a fork and hack away at the codebase. We will start an Open Source forum on the Frictional Games forums as a place to talk about changes and to submit patches from your forks.
